## About Me:
I’m Nidal Souk, a passionate Data Engineer and Data Scientist with strong expertise in data engineering, cloud technologies, and machine learning. With a Master’s degree in Data Science and hands-on experience from my apprenticeship at Amadeus, I have developed skills in building robust data pipelines, working with Azure Cloud, Spark, Scala, and deploying ML models.

My projects range from churn prediction using classification models to large-scale ETL workflows and fraud detection in the travel industry. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, optimizing data workflows, and presenting insights through interactive dashboards.

Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I’m eager to contribute to impactful data projects and collaborate within the data community.
